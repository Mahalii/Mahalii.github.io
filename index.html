    <h2>Personal Self-Assessment</h2>
    <p>
      My journey through the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University has been both demanding and incredibly fulfilling. Before enrolling, I had no background in software engineering. Currently, I serve as a Project Manager at a healthcare company and have previously worked as a software engineer. This transition marked a pivotal shift in my career‚Äîone that required me to think creatively, problem-solve effectively, and adapt quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a deep love for technology and am driven to make a meaningful impact‚Äînot only through direct patient care but now also by developing innovative medical software. With my background in healthcare and new technical skills, I aim to contribute to transformative tools for the industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      I faced many challenges, from learning programming languages to solving coding problems without prior CS mentorship. But I never gave up. Java became my primary language, and I also explored Python, C++, and MySQL. Rebuilding and enhancing a messaging app in Sublime Text showed me how far I‚Äôd come.

    <h2>Code Review & Enhancements</h2>
    <h3>Software Design</h3>
    <p>
      An initial code review was performed on the artifact. The purpose of the code review was to identify the enhancements that could be made to the code. The main enhancements that I planned were:Adding extra functionlity to the Java Code. Adding Pandas dataframe functionality instead of class management. Adding database functionality to store data before closing the application. Adding a main function to function as the application.
      The main enhancement for my software design was adding code to expand the finctionality of my application. To implement this, I took my Java classes and created accompanying pseudocode. Then I enhanced the sourcde code in Java to add additional functinalities.
    </p>

    <h3>Algorithms and Data Structures</h3>
    <p>
      One significant enhancement I implemented was the addition of a main function to serve as the centralized entry point for the application. This allowed for more organized execution of the program‚Äôs logic and ensured a clear, structured flow of operations. By encapsulating the primary logic within this function, the application became more modular, maintainable, and easier to debug or extend in the future. In addition, I utilized Pandas DataFrames to efficiently manage the application's data and facilitate advanced data handling, such as filtering and search functionality. This not only improved the overall performance but also provided a more intuitive and powerful way to process and analyze user inputs and search results.
    </p>

    <h3>Databases</h3>
    <p>
      The final enhancement to my project was the integration of full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality using a MongoDB database, which significantly improved the application's ability to manage data persistently. Prior to this addition, all data existed only temporarily during runtime and was lost upon closing the application. By integrating MongoDB, I enabled the application to store structured data from a Pandas DataFrame into a NoSQL database collection, allowing users to seamlessly save their session data. This enhancement makes it possible to add new entries, retrieve and view existing records, update specific fields, and delete unnecessary or outdated information‚Äîall while maintaining a scalable and efficient backend system that could be extended for future development or deployment in a real-world environment.
