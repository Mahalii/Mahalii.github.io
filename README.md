# Personal Self-assessment

My journey through the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University has been both demanding and incredibly fulfilling. Before enrolling, I had no background in software engineering. Currently, I serve as a Project Manager at a healthcare company and have previously worked as a software engineer. This transition marked a pivotal shift in my career—one that required me to think creatively, problem-solve effectively, and adapt quickly. It was this desire for growth that led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering.

People often ask me why I made such a drastic change. My answer is simple: I have a deep love for technology, and I’m driven to make a meaningful impact—not only through direct patient care but now also by developing innovative medical software that improves lives. With my background in healthcare and my new technical skills, I’m determined to contribute to the creation of transformative tools for the industry.

From the beginning, I was prepared for the hard work and long nights. There were moments of self-doubt and frustration—times when I struggled to grasp programming languages, solve coding challenges, or even find guidance from someone with a computer science background. Despite the obstacles, giving up was never an option. I’ve always welcomed challenges, and I faced each course one step at a time. Now, as I reach the end of my program, I recognize that learning never stops, and I remain committed to growing and evolving as a professional in this field.

Throughout the program, I worked with several programming languages and technologies. Java became my primary language, and although I still have more to learn, I’ve grown confident in my abilities and eager to improve further. I also explored MySQL, where I rebuilt a messaging app originally created in Codio, using Sublime Text to enhance both its structure and functionality. My journey began with Python, which felt intuitive, but C++ introduced new challenges. Then came Java, which offered the structure of C++ but with concepts I found more approachable and easier to master.

# Code Review: 

An initial code review was performed on the artifact. The purpose of the code review was to identify the enhancements that could be made to the code. The main enhancements that I planned were:

Porting code over to Python instead of Java
Adding Pandas dataframe functionality instead of class management
Adding database functionality to store data before closing the application
Adding a main function to function as the application.

Software Design
The main enhancement for my software design was porting my code over to Python. To implement this, I took my Java classes and created accompanying pseudocode. Then I enhanced the sourcde code in Java to add additional functinalities.

Algorithms and Data Structure
One addition I had to make was adding a main function to the application. This could then perform the main logic for the application. I also implemented Pandas dataframe structuring to handle my application data and search results.

Databases
The final addition was implementing a CRUD functionality for MongoDB database at the end of the application. This allows the data to be added, deleted, updated and found. It takes the dataframe and stores it as a database table.
